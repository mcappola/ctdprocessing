These PSA and batch files are set up for use with the Palmer LTER Program. 

They assume use with a dual SBE9plus with additional sensors:
- Dual SBE43 Oxygen Sensors
- WET Labs ECO-AFL/FL Fluorescence Sensor
- WET Labs C-Star Beam Transmission Sensor
- Biospherical/Licor PAR/Irradiance Sensor

PSA settings are set up for use with polar water. This affects the oxygen sensor.
